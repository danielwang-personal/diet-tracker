# DIET VISUALISER by Daniel WANG

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key functionality

- Total calories for the day displayed at the top
- Graph for macronutrients displayed right under
- Input food that you have eaten throughout the day
- Call to API to access macronutrient info 
- Entered food are listed down below
- Entered food is categorised into breakfast, lunch or dinner

## TODO:
- Redo styling in index.css
- Modify the form to enter just the food, and meal type (brekky, lunch, dinner)
- Expand to fullstack MERN app (need Mongo to store logins)
- Find an API to use for getting nutritional information
- Find an autofill API
